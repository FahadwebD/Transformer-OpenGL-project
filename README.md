# Transformer-OpenGL-project

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the working of the transformers through animation. The robot is transformed to a vehicle by repositioning the body parts of robot. First we can see a robot in the desert which will automatically be transformed to a vehicle and moves on the road track. The whole project is done using OpenGL.
The output animation of the project gives user a feeling as if he is watching an animated movie. It is important to know about the transformers as many people say transformers will replace everything in the future. By watching the animation, user can know the working of transformers.
I was motivated to for this project after I watched the movie ‘Transformers’. I always wonder if I have a small machine which can help me on all my works and that was transformers.



##  FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

The following are some of the future scopes:
The project can be developed in by using the less codes and the mathematical functions also can be used for calculating the values.

It can also be used as an animation video to demonstrate the working of transformers.

The output screen can be recorded and we can make a short animated video.

The animation will look much better if we show the movement of both robot and the vehicle.

## BIBLIOGRAPHY:
A number of different sources were thoroughly searched for reference material. The major source being of our library books and the internet (numerous websites and pages including those of reputed universities and companies). Paper presentations available on the net were immense help. Previous works and ideas by seniors have been incorporated to produce this editor. Help pages provided excellent understanding of the concepts associated with C- programming.
